# WSL Help Commands

This commands will help you to control and confiuger the WSL.

Use this command to see the current instants.
```bash
wsl -l -v
```
Use this command to see the available distro that you can install.
```bash
wsl -l -o
```

## Install WSL

Install common WSL distribution.
```bash
wsl --install
```
Install WSL distro as you like by replacing the distro name with `<distro>` in command.
```bash
wsl --install -d <distro>
```
> **Note:** When you want to install multiple distributions, I recommend you to use the Microsoft Store.

## Run Multiple Instants Using Export & Import

### Export
Using this command, you can backup the already installed distro in WSL. you can export the instant as `.tar` file.

Replace the `<Distro Name>` with actual distro name (use `wsl -l -v` to see all actual names) and replace the `<Distro Backup File Path>`‚Å£ with actual file path to the backup `.tar` file.
```bash
wsl --export <Distro Name> <Distro Backup File Path>
```
Example:
```bash
wsl --export ex-distro c:\path\to\backup-folder\ex-distro-backup.tar
```

### import

After exporting the instant, you can import the instant again as new instant in the WSL.

Replace the `<New Distro Name>` as you like (this is a new name for the instant). Replace the `<Distro Install Path>` with the path you want to store the instant files. Replace the `<Distro Backup File Location>` with the actual location of the backup `.tar` file of the distro.
```bash
wsl --import <New Distro Name> <Distro Install Path> <Distro Backup File Location>
```
Example:
```bash
wsl --import ex-new-distro c:\path\to\wsl-install-folder c:\path\to\backup-folder\ex-distro-backup.tar
```
